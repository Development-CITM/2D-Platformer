# Rumble in the Jungle

Hi there! We're a pair of students from CITM's-UPC currently coursing the degree: Videogame Design & Development.
This right here is our little game for Development subject. We used C++ Language for the coding stuff via SDL and pugi libraries. Plus we used Tiled for creating the structure of the map, loading it's colliders and even the player animations.

#### Team members

* Eudald Garrofé: https://github.com/Hevne <br>
Eudald has been in charge of the game and level design, plus searching and implementing the art of the game, in addition he has been coding side by side with Jordi too.<br>

* Jordi Pardo: https://github.com/Jordi-Pardo <br>
Jordi has been the lead programmer, building the major part of the project skeleton, although he helped with art research and some of the game design desicions.<br><br>

Concluding, even if we have different kind of profiles and interests, each one tried to generally work at everything.<br>
Since this is a professional-kind readme we're not gonna put in here which features did each one. This info is in the commits history.<br>
