# Snowy Mists

Hi there! We're a pair of students from CITM's-UPC currently coursing the degree: Videogame Design & Development.
This right here is our little game for Development subject. We used C++ Language for the coding stuff via SDL and pugi libraries. Plus we used Tiled for creating the structure of the map, loading it's colliders and even the player animations.
