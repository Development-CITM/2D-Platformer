# Rumble in the Jungle

Hi there! We're a pair of students from CITM's-UPC currently coursing the degree: Videogame Design & Development.
This right here is our little game for Development subject. We used C++ Language for the coding stuff via SDL and pugi libraries. Plus we used Tiled for creating the structure of the map, loading it's colliders and even the player animations.

#### Team members

* Eudald Garrofé: https://github.com/Hevne <br>
Eudald has been in charge of the game and level design, plus searching and implementing the art of the game, in addition he has been coding too.<br>
Tiled map,levels loading, colliders in tiled, debug functions, spritesheet in tiled, audio...

* Jordi Pardo: https://github.com/Jordi-Pardo <br>
Jordi has been the lead programmer, building the major part of the project skeleton, although he helped with art research and some of the game design desicions.<br>
Camera, Movement, dash, loading animations from tiled, colliders prediction, culling...  <br>

Concluding, even if we have different kind of profiles and interests, each one tried to generally work at everything.<br>

### Controls

* D: Move Right
* A: Move Left
* S while on top of a small floating platform: Traspass platform down
* W while jumping: Small dash on air
* SPACE/SPACE+A/SPACE+D: Jump/Jump left/Jump right
